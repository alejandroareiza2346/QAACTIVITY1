## 1. Purpose

This document defines and supports the academic analysis related to the cost of not certifying quality processes in a software product, considering international standards and recognized industry best practices.

---

## 2. Scope

This work applies to software development environments seeking to ensure:

- Product quality  
- Customer trust  
- Reduction of operational risks  
- Compliance with international standards  

It does not include technical implementation or formal certification, but rather conceptual and critical analysis.

---

## 3. Normative Framework

- International Software Testing Qualification Board (ISTQB)  
- ISO 9001:2015  
- ISO/IEC 25010 (Software Product Quality Model)

---

## 4. Identified Problem

The absence of certification in quality processes leads to:

- Increased production failures  
- Financial and reputational risks  
- Loss of competitiveness  
- Higher late-stage correction costs  

---

## 5. Technical Justification

Failing to subject a product to formal quality standards implies:

- Lack of independent validation  
- Weak requirements traceability  
- Deficiencies in structured testing  
- Risk to software sustainability  

From an engineering perspective, quality must be managed in a preventive and systematic manner.

---

## 6. Conclusions

Quality process certification should not be considered an expense, but a strategic investment.  
The structured implementation of international standards strengthens reliability, reduces risk, and improves an organization's competitive positioning.
